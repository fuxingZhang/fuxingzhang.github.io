    <h2>Software Integrity</h2>
    <p>Perfection is the goal, but occasional bugs may appear. I deeply value the trust you place in my apps, yet I cannot promise complete flawlessness. For your peace of mind, regular backups are highly recommended.</p>

    <p>You agree to indemnify me against any claims, liabilities, damages, or expenses arising from your use of the apps or breach of these terms.</p>

    <h2>Refunds</h2>
    <p>For apps purchased on the Apple App Store, you can <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/118223">request a refund</a> . However, I would appreciate if you reached out first. I may be able to resolve any problems you are having.</p>
